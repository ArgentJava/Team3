# Team3 <RankMates>
## Social platform that lets you pit your friends against eachother to find your real mates!
- We were inspired by MySpace's friend feature that let you choose the best friends you wanted displayed on your page.
- It's a fun application that excersizes many C++ practices to display the new skills we've developed over the corse.
- While simply fun, RankMate keeps track of your friendship scores, rewarding and promoting those you share the most interests with, and encoraging new friendships.
